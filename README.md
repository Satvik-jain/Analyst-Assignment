#Investment team assignment

This repository contains the code and materials for the assignment. The assignment helped me learn dynamic web scraping, utilizing Jupyter Notebook, and working with Google Colaboratory.

I enjoyed doing the Assignment!!!

I learned a lot of amazing stuff, from several domains, including how to work with jupyter and google collaborate.

Assignment also pushed me to learn dynamic Web-scrapping, which again I enjoyed.

I have done Question 1, 2(a), 2(b) because I dont want to leave any stone unturned!!!
